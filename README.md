# Binance Futures Position Alerter

This application monitors a Binance user's leaderboard for new or closed futures positions and provides real-time audio and visual alerts.

It is a pure frontend application that runs entirely in your browser. It does not require a backend server. Instead, you manually provide the position data directly from the Binance website.
